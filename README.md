# Music Releases
This is a music release site that pulls data from a static API. This site is built using React 👩‍🎤🥁🎙🥳

## Code
I've used:
  * **Pair-programming**
  * **React.js**
  * **JSX**
  * **JavaScript**
  * **CSS**

## The problem
We a design to follow and made that our plan. This was our first project using React and therefor we did alot of trial and error. If we had more time to spend on this project we would do the stretch goal wich was to make a sidebar.
